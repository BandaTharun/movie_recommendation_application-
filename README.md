Movie recommendation system

ðŸš€  DevOps project: a **Movie Recommendation System** with a robust CI/CD pipeline! ðŸŽ¬

This project highlights my expertise in implementing advanced CI/CD practices using Azure DevOps and ArgoCD, tailored for a seamless deployment experience. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

ðŸ”¹ **CI/CD Pipelines:** Leveraging Azure DevOps, I've set up automated pipelines that detect changes in the Frontend and Backend codebases within a GitHub repository. These pipelines build Docker images, push them to Docker Hub, and update Kubernetes deployment manifests with the new Docker tags, ensuring every commit triggers an efficient and reliable deployment process.

ðŸ”¹ **ArgoCD Integration:** ArgoCD continuously monitors the Kubernetes deployment files (frontend_server.yml and backend_server.yml) for updates. Upon detecting changes, ArgoCD automatically manages the continuous deployment process, redeploying services in the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster without manual intervention.

ðŸ”¹ **Component Separation:** The architecture is designed with a clear separation between the frontend and backend components, enabling independent updates and deployments, which streamlines the overall process and enhances maintainability.

This setup not only automates the entire build and deployment pipeline but also ensures a high level of reliability and scalability, showcasing my ability to deliver efficient and scalable DevOps solutions.
